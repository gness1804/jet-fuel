##Completion

###Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes.

###Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

##Code Quality

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[Our sort function!](https://github.com/gness1804/jet-fuel/blob/master/public/index.js#L152-L188)

####Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This piece of code sorts the URLs by popularity. We are proud of this code because it performs a complex function effectively and we both work together to solve the problems in it. It also involved a vanilla JS XMLHttpRequest(), which allows use to dive more deeply into the http request logic than a wrapper from a library would have.

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Our showOneFolder and showURL functions](https://github.com/gness1804/jet-fuel/blob/c8003c6bd530afb3cff659749bf0e883d1bcdc63/public/index.js#L42-L122)

####Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This code is overly long and repetitive. We did not have time to refactor, and there is a lot of repetition. We could combine functions like  this into a single function, and also break out functions into smaller functions and separate files. We did not get around to doing a lot of this type of refactoring that would have helped the code be more readable and maintainable.

Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
